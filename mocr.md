Manual version 0.8311.0-git (for MOCR / "MOCRL" version 0.85)

This manual isn't necessarily realistic, and is not crew-rated.

This manual assumes you have already read the MCC-manual

## Controls

## Voice chat

MOCR has built in support for voice-chat. Voice-chat is not enabled by default at the moment, but is enabled by pressing the ðŸ”Š-icon in the upper right of the intercom ![](images/generic/intercom-room-chat-v0_8093.png).

When you do this, a few things will come up:

![](images/generic/voice-settings-v0_8093.png)

1. In the lower right, you'll see a button marked **VOICE CONNECT**. If you want to hear from or speak to the other players in the session, you need to click this. If the button is marked "Voice Disconnect", you're already set for the next step.

2. InGame settings. Here you need to click **Transmit**. Secondly, if you don't want to use Push To Talk (PTT), you need to select VoiceDetection. Note that VoiceDetection might not be enabled in the current build.

You should now be setup for receiving, and optionally transmitting voice.

Now for the next step: Who do you want to listen to, and who do you want to talk to. In order to select this, you need to find a console. The quickest way to do this, is to use the view-selector. If you can't see the View-selector on the left of your screen, press V. Make sure to select a console that's not already crewed.

![](images/generic/VOX-setup-AG-only-v0_8093.png)

The exact layout of the voice-setup buttons varies by console, but the generally setup is the same. The **yellow** buttons indicate what you're listening to. A lit indicator indicates that you're listening to that loop. Additionally, make sure that PABX and PABX ON are both lit. In the above example, I'm only listening to the A/G loop (Air / Ground). The **white** buttons are used to select which loop you talk into, when you talk. A blinking white indicator indicates that a given loop is selected for speaking into.

![](images/generic/VOX-setup-listen-all-v0_8093.png)

In the above example you I've chosen to listen to all loops, and speaking to the A/G loop.

![](images/generic/VOX-setup-listen-flight-and-asst-flight-speak-asst-flight-v0_8093.png)

In the above example on the other hand, I've chosen to only listen to the assistant flight director and the flight director loops, and to speak on the assistant flight loop.

### CAPCOM

### FAO

### PAO

### BOOSTER

![BOOSTER console overview 2](./images/main-room/TEMP-dummy-booster-02-v0_7544.png)

Booster is responsible for monitoring the Saturn up to and including LV separation.
Booster has three screens to keep a track of everything. Left and center is controlled through one set of dials, right is controlled through a second set.

### RETRO

### GUIDANCE

### Flight Director

The flight director role is mostly the same as in Mercury. This includes holding or proceeding the count.

### Assistant Flight Director

The assistant flight director role, is as the name implies to assist the flight director. In addition, they have the responsibility of selecting what should be shown on the [](#big-screens). This is done in a similar way to selecting content for the small screens (See [Screens](#screens)), with the addition of a few buttons to select the projectors.

## Big screens

Left to right

1. LEFT PROJ TV
2. CENTER LEFT PROJ TV
3. MAIN PROJ SCREEN
4. AUX PROJ SCREEN
5. RIGHT PROJ TV

## Screens

Each console has a number of 14" screens. With these you can look at a number of channels with various data. One way of selecting the data to be shown is to use TV-mode.

To select a TV-mode channel:

1. Press TV mode
2. Select the channel with the appropriate input selector, depending on which screen you want to put it on. If you're unsure of which channel you want, select [TV-guide (channel XX)](#16-tv-guide).
3. Now one or more buttons should light up, depending on how many screens controlled by that input selector. Press the relevant screen by pushing selecting it under "ENTER".

### TV channels

## RTCC

NASAs Real-Time Computing Complex, which resides at the first floor of building 30, the same building that houses MOCR 1 and 2, houses 5 IBM 360/75 computers, of which at any time 2 are used redundantly (1 active, 1 hotswap) to support the flight, while the others are used for sims, experiments, etc, and can be swapped in to replace one of the two flight support computers. Data from the RTCC is primarily fed into the display control system, including the television slide display, which is responsible for controlling the overlays used in the above-mentioned TV-system.

To access RTCC programs, you must first:

1. Be in a console that supports RTCC data. This includes [BOOSTER](#booster) and [GUIDANCE](#guidance)
2. Select the [RTCC TV-channel (channel 90)](#90-rtcc)
3. Press the LOAD/INITIATE button (upper half)
4. Using the keyboard below it, enter the four-digit load-line for the program you want to access (XXXX for program guide)
5. Now press the INITIATE part of the previously mentioned button
6. It should now show the selected load-number.

To input a line of data, do the same thing, but with LINE/INITIATE instead

In the case of GUIDANCE you use the left keyboard to input load-numbers and to input a line, and the right keyboard for DSKY inputs.

## Room settings

![](./images/generic/room-settings-v0_7601.png)

This menu-options lets you switch between light/dark, toggle detail-objects, and toggle the simplified view, all of whom may increase your performance

## Other

IDRK where to put it, but there's a clock some where that can count up or down, and prob take the number from somewhere IDK

Also, troublemakers are a thing, basically the same as before (though now a real-life trouble-maker can do annoying things on voice).
